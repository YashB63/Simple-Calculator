# Simple-Calculator
A simple calculator is a tool designed to perform mathematical calculations.

It typically consists of a keypad with numerical buttons (0-9) and various arithmetic operation buttons such as addition (+), subtraction (-), multiplication (x), division (/), and equals (=). The user enters numbers and operations using the keypad, and the calculator displays the result of the calculation on a screen.
